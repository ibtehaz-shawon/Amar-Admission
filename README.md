"Amar Admission" is a firefox app challenge project created using Javascript and plain HTML and CSS. The project's primary objective was to help users to know which universities they will be able to take admission to based on their SSC and HSC exam. Due to time limitation, the project is somewhat unfinished and contains a lot of bugs. The project has not been touched since 2014.
